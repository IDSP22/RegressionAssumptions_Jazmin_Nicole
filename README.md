# RegressionAssumptions_Jazmin_Nicole
A shiny app  that combines data checks and preparation in understanding regression assumptions

For this assignment we focused in adding a Data Analysis section in the Challenge page. This section will help the user evaluate how data looked before modeling and if it made sense to use linear regression. 

We thought that it will be good to include a data analysis section in the app because looking directly at diagnostic plots, might mislead users into believing that the post-modeling analysis is the only way to analyze this assumptions.

The code was based on the Boast Applications (https://psu-eberly.shinyapps.io/Assumptions/). And what we modified was:

* Add a Data analysis section into the Challenge page. We add some interactive scatter plots and box plots. 
* We add description on how data analysis could be done.
