# RegressionAssumptions_Jazmin_Nicole
A shiny app  that combines data checks and preparation in understanding regression assumptions

For this assignment we focused in adding a Data Analysis section in the Challenge page. This section will help the user evaluate how data looked before modeling and if it made sense to use linear regression. 

The base for the code was taken from the Boast Applications (insert link). And what we modified was:

* Splitting the code into ui and server files. Additionally, did some cleaning in the global libraries and functions. 
* Add a Data analysis section into the Challenge page. We add some interactive scatter plots and box plots. 
* We add description on how data analysis could be done.
