# RegressionAssumptions_Jazmin_Nicole
A shiny app  that combines data checks and preparation in understanding regression assumptions

For this assignment we focused in adding a Data Analysis section. This section will help the user evaluate how data looked before modeling and if it made sense to use linear regression. The reason this section comes after the diagnostics, is for the user to understand that there is a process that need to be done before running regression. 

The base for the code was taken from the Boat Applications (insert link). And we modified:

* Line 48: In the ui we included a new tab for the Data Analysis section. (change icon)
* Line 322: In the ui we call for the new scatter plots and boxplots that can help us analyze the data better. (Add more info on how to use these plots)
* Line 1,272: We include the code to plot the new graphs.
